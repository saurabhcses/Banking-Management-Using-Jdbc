Bank Management System using JDBC

Here is a high-level overview of a bank management system using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):

System Requirements

Java 8 or higher
JDBC driver for the chosen database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
Database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
System Design

The bank management system will consist of the following components:

1. Database Design
Customers Table: customer_id (primary key), name, address, phone_number, email
Accounts Table: account_id (primary key), customer_id (foreign key), account_type (e.g., savings, checking), balance
Transactions Table: transaction_id (primary key), account_id (foreign key), transaction_date, transaction_type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal), amount
2. Java Application
The Java application will use JDBC to interact with the database. It will provide the following functionality:

Customer Management:
Create new customer
Update customer information
Delete customer
Account Management:
Create new account
Update account information
Delete account
Transaction Management:
Deposit money into an account
Withdraw money from an account
Transfer money between accounts
Reporting:
Generate customer statements
Generate account summaries
3. JDBC Connection
The Java application will use JDBC to connect to the database. The connection will be established using the following steps:

Load the JDBC driver
Establish a connection to the database
Create a statement object
Execute SQL queries using the statement object
Close the connection
